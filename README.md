Get acquainted with git and github

## Getting started
In order to contribute, you have to **clone the repository**.

Extra Info: Cloning creates a local copy of the remote repository. You can edit your local copy, and push it back to remote.
Then, other people can pull from remote in order to updated their locals with your latest changes.
You can also pull from remote to get their latest changes

**IMPORTANT:** cloning is only done once. Once you have a repository cloned, you can simply run `git pull` to update it.

Steps:
- Click the green "clone" button on the main page of the repository
- Select "https" and copy the URL
- Open your terminal and type the command `git clone <url>`

After you complete this, you should now find the repository as a folder on your computer.
